We release of a new dataset called AR-LQ that can be used in conjunction with the well-known AR dataset to evaluate face recognition algorithms on blurred and low-resolution face images. The dataset contains five new blurred faces (at five different levels, from low to severe blurriness) and five new low-resolution images (at five different levels, from 66x48 to 7x5 pixels) for each of the hundred subjects of the AR dataset.

AR-LQ contains 100 subjects, 50 males and 50 females.

The file name follows this format:

face_xxx_yy.png

xxx: id of the subject from 001 to 199
yy : number of the face images

- original face images:
yy = 01, 02, ... 26 are the original numbers of AR face images

- low resolution face images
yy = 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 are L1, L2, L3, L4 and L5 respectively 


- blurred face images
yy = 32, 33, 34, 35, 36 are B1, B2, L3, B4 and B5 respectively
